#### [Metal Machining](https://github.com/tvhahn/Manufacturing-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Metal%20Machining)

Anomaly detection as applied to metal machining using the UC Berkely milling data set.  The data set can be downloaded from the the [NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence website](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/).

- [1.A_milling-data-exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/tvhahn/Manufacturing-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Metal%20Machining/1.A_milling-data-exploration.ipynb) explores the milling data set. You'll get familiar with the data set and visualize the cutting signals. My [blog post](https://www.tvhahn.com/posts/milling/) explains the notebook in detail, and you can run the notebook [here]((https://colab.research.google.com/github/tvhahn/Manufacturing-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Metal%20Machining/1.A_milling-data-exploration.ipynb)).

- [1.B_building-vae.ipynb](https://github.com/tvhahn/Manufacturing-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Metal%20Machining/1.B_building-vae.ipynb) lays out the construction and training of a variational autoencoder (VAE) using the milling data. Here's the [blog post](https://www.tvhahn.com/posts/building-vae/) explaining the notebook, and you can run the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tvhahn/Manufacturing-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Metal%20Machining/1.A_milling-data-exploration.ipynb).
